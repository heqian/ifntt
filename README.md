## Description
Trigger IFTTT Webhooks: https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks

For example, if you have a Webhook with an event name "turn_off_light" in IFTTT, you can trigger this Webhook by asking Nigel, "(trigger|send|run|execute) command", and then say, "turn off light":
1. "Listen up, Nigel" (to wake up N)
1. "Send command" (to start "ifntt" segment)
1. "Turn off light" (to specify the command)
1. A Webhook called "turn_off_light" on IFTTT will be triggered

## How to create a Webhook on IFTTT
